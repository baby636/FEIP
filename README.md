=====================================

## What is FEIP
-------
FEIP(Freecash extended Improvement Protocol) is the standard for Freecash ecology. 
The difference from FIP/BIP is that FEIP is the protocol for the useage of OP_RETURN.
For the long-term growth of Freecash ecologyï¼Œwe strongly recommend that the third-party Dapps follow FEIP.
